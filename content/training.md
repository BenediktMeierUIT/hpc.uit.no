# Training

Most courses we do are developed and organized together with
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) and
[NRIS](https://documentation.sigma2.no/).

You can also join our [email newsletter](@/contact.md) to stay up-to-date about
courses and events.


## Upcoming courses we recommend

- In the autumn we will organize courses on "HPC On-boarding" and "Best Practices on NRIS Clusters" (dates to be announced soon).
- We also plan a new intermediate course to provide a smoother progression from the On-boarding course.
- In September we will contribute to a [CodeRefinery
  workshop](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/). We have written a
  [blog post](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2023/06/25/planning-sep-workshop/)
  where we summarize planned improvements.
- We plan a "Python for Scientific Computing" course in November (dates to be announced soon).
