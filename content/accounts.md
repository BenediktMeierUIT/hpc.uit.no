# Access to a test or course account

If you are affiliated with UiT, then we want to help you with getting access to
high-performance computing (HPC) resources.  Sometimes it can help to have a
test account so that you can experiment some and run few benchmarks before
submitting a formal application.  We also wish to make it easy for you to get
course accounts if you plan to teach using HPC resources.


## Test accounts

- If you wish to try out [NRIS hpc-services](https://www.sigma2.no/service/high-performance-computing) for your own research, [apply
here](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/hpc/) for an access to project "NN8999K: HPC testing for UiT users".

- If you wish to try out either [NIRD storage services](https://www.sigma2.no/service/nird-data-peak) or  [NRIS services for advanced pre/postprocessing of large datasets](https://www.sigma2.no/service/nird-service-platform) for your research, [apply here](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/storage/) for access to account "NS8999K: NIRD testing for UiT users".

For both sets of applications, please make sure that you use your UiT e-mail when signing up. Further instructions will follow via e-mail.

These accounts are also available for covering immediate demand for larger scale computational resources, UiT student-courses and UiT-hands-on sessions where computational cluster resources may be useful. 


## Course accounts

If you are holding courses that could benefit from access to our HPC-resources,
then we wish to help you with that.

We have disposable course-accounts that can be used by the learners and will be
wiped after each semester/course period. The course instructor will get a list
of corresponding usernames and passwords and can by themselves distribute the
accounts.

It is also possible for someone from our team to contribute with an
introduction seminar on how to get started with the HPC systems.  If this is
interesting for you or your faculty, please [contact us](/contact/).


## Getting started

To get started using the you could either sign up for one of our
[training](/training/) or dive into our
[documentation](https://documentation.sigma2.no/).
