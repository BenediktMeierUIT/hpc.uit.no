# Access to a test or course account

If you are affiliated with UiT, then we want to help you with getting access to
high-performance computing (HPC) resources.  Sometimes it can help to have a
test account so that you can experiment some and run few benchmarks before
submitting a formal application.  We also wish to make it easy for you to get
course accounts if you plan to teach using HPC resources.


## Test account

If you wish to try out the resources for your own research, [apply
here](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/notur/) for an user
account for project "NN8999K: Running recruitment UiT". Make sure that you use
your UiT e-mail when signing up. Further instructions will follow via e-mail.


## Course accounts

If you are holding courses that could benefit from access to our HPC-resources,
then we wish to help you with that.

We have disposable course-accounts that can be used by the learners and will be
wiped after each semester/course period. The course instructor will get a list
of corresponding usernames and passwords and can by themselves distribute the
accounts.

It is also possible for someone from our team to contribute with an
introduction seminar on how to get started with the HPC systems.  If this is
interesting for you or your faculty, please [contact us](/contact/).


## Getting started

To get started using the you could either sign up for one of our
[courses](/courses/) or dive into our
[documentation](https://documentation.sigma2.no/).
