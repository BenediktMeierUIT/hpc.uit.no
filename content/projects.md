## Magnars projects

### GPU Team and CUDA Programming
As part of the High Performance Computing (HPC) group at our university,
I specialize in operating within the GPU team. My primary focus lies on CUDA
programming, primarily for NVIDIA GPUs integrated into the SAGA and Betzy HPC
systems. These powerful systems leverage the computational capabilities of GPUs
to perform complex mathematical computations, leading to more efficient
scientific computing and simulations. Through CUDA, we're able to unlock the
potential of these GPUs, granting researchers the tools needed to drive
breakthroughs across various fields.


### Transition to LUMI and HIP
Recently, my work has been evolving to include more involvement with the LUMI HPC system, which utilizes AMD GPUs. This transition requires a shift from the CUDA programming language to Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (HIP). HIP is AMD's language that allows CUDA codes to be ported into a format that AMD GPUs can understand, broadening the application of our research and computational capabilities. The future will certainly be rich with HIP as we continue to adapt and optimize for different platforms and computing environments.

### Porting Codes from CPU to GPU and CUDA to HIP

In the upcoming period, I'm excited to be dedicating my time to the porting of codes from CPU to GPU, as well as from CUDA to HIP. Porting involves translating software to function in a different computing environment than originally intended. The shift from CPU to GPU computing can lead to significant improvements in computing speed and efficiency, due to the GPUs' ability to handle multiple tasks concurrently. Transitioning from CUDA to HIP, on the other hand, will allow our codebase to be more versatile, functional across both NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures.
### GPU Documentation
In an effort to bridge the knowledge gap and foster user accessibility, I actively contribute to the GPU documentation at documentation.sigma2.no. This documentation acts as a comprehensive guide for users of our HPC systems, covering everything from basic operations to advanced troubleshooting. By developing clear and detailed instructions, we hope to empower users to fully utilize our HPC resources, thus boosting productivity and innovation.
### Support for HPC Systems in Norway
In addition to my technical roles, I also provide support for the HPC systems in Norway. This involves troubleshooting system issues, optimizing system performance, and assisting users with any challenges they encounter. I'm proud to be part of a network that ensures the smooth operation of these high-powered computational tools, as they are essential to numerous scientific research endeavors.
### Research Software Engineering at UiT
Lastly, I am also deeply involved in the Research Software Engineering (RSE) effort at the University of Tromsø – The Arctic University of Norway (UiT). As part of this initiative, I collaborate with researchers to develop, maintain, and optimize research software. Our goal is to facilitate more efficient, reproducible, and reliable research by leveraging the power of modern computing. It's an exciting and rewarding intersection of academia and technology that continually drives me to learn and innovate.
