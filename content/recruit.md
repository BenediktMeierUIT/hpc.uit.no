# Recruitment
The HPC-team at UiT has a service where everyone from UiT can try out the national HPC-resources for either their own research or for courses. Here you can get access to either a predefined user account, or you can get your own. 

## How to get access for yourself
If you want to try out the resources for your own research; Go to [this site](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/notur/) and apply for an user account for project "NN8999K: Running recruitment UiT". Make sure that you use your UiT e-mail when signing up. Further instructions will follow on e-mail.

## How to get access for courses
If you are holding corses that could benefit from access to our HPC-resources we are capable of helping with that. We have predefined course-accounts that can be used by the students for a course that will be wiped after each semester/course period. The course instructor will get a list of corresponding usernames and passwords and can by themselves distribute the accounts. This limits the hassle of every student needing to apply by themselves. 

It is also possible for someone from our team to contribute with an introduction seminar on how to get started with the HPC systems. This limits the required expertise needed by the lectures and course holders. 

If this is interesting for you or your faculty, please contact us at [email@email.email](mailto:email@email.email)

## Getting started
